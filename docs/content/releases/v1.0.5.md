## Release v1.0.5 (2025-11-29)

### Changes
- fix(loader): correctly validate .ndjson files when extension is provided, resolving NDJSON fallback and allowing Indexly-exported concatenated logs to be analyzed directly
- feat(log-clean): added multi-log cleaning with NDJSON/CSV export, path normalization and filename sanitization
- fix(analyze-json): prevent fallback warnings for structured JSON inputs and improve structured detection
- feat(json): added Socrata/OpenData JSON detection with safe streaming extractor for large datasets
- fix(json): unified JSON analysis logic and ensured correct scalar statistics persistence
- feat(json): enhanced JSON pipeline with deeper structure handling, array summarization, and improved metadata propagation
- fix(json): corrected test-case handling, flattening logic, and numeric-like string normalization
- feat(json): introduced json_cache_normalizer and integrated stable cache normalization into JSON pipeline
- feat(xml): implemented full generic XML analysis, including XRechnung (all 3 formats), nested dictionaries, and invoice-compatible treeview summaries
- fix(xml): resolved dataset summary preview by properly using db_dict/summary fallbacks
- feat(excel): added multi-sheet Excel support and unified loader behavior for XLSX metadata and summaries
- feat(parquet): improved parquet analysis pipeline, normalization, markdown summary, and treeview generation
- feat(csv): unified CSV/Parquet/Excel export logic and improved CSV visualization & summary statistics
- feat(timeseries): enhanced multi-series time-series pipeline with aggregation, resampling, and visualization integration
- feat(visualization): improved visualization pipeline (Plotly + Matplotlib) and stabilized column type inference

- feat(cleaning): added advanced CSV auto-clean pipeline with robust chunking, fallback logic, summary persistence, and error handling
- feat(loader): improved universal loader detection across CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, Excel, and Parquet, ensuring safer DataFrame assignment
- feat(analysis): unified orchestration layer for analyze-file, analyze-json, and analyze-csv to guarantee predictable pipeline delegation
- feat(search-cache): added JSON normalization and improved hierarchical summary handling for summarize-search
- feat(cli): improved CLI version output, license excerpt, and project-links in --version
